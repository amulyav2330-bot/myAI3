## 💻 Senior Lead Engineer Prompt: Final Branding & Chat UI Refinement (V2.2)

**To:** Senior Lead Engineer
**From:** Product Manager
**Project:** Final UI/UX Polish on the **Solstice Chat Interface**
**Deployment Environment:** Replit

**Objective:** Implement the final logo, background styling, and custom greeting within the chat application to enhance brand presence and user engagement.

### **I. Branding & Styling Protocol**

1.  **Logo Update (CRITICAL):**
      * **Replace** the existing logo file across all pages (especially the header component) with the newly uploaded logo image .
2.  **Color Extraction:**
      * Analyze the new logo image. For styling purposes, use the following representative hex codes derived from the logo's color palette:
          * **Primary Brand Accent (Deep Blue/Teal):** `#00796B` (Used for chat accents, buttons).
          * **Secondary Brand Accent (Warm Gold/Yellow):** `#FFB300` (Used for subtle highlighting).
          * **Background Accent (Light Grey/Blue Tint):** `#F0F4F8` (Used for main chat background).

### **II. Chat Interface (`/app/chat/demo`) Implementation**

The existing functionality must be preserved. Only styling and the initial message are being updated.

| Feature | Requirement | Technical Implementation Details |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Header Logo Integration** | Display the new logo image  prominently at the **top center or top left** of the chat window interface. | Ensure the logo scales correctly on mobile devices without distortion. |
| **Custom Background & Fade** | Add a custom, visually appealing background to the main chat area. | Use a **slowly fading, low-opacity background image** of a generic solar panel array or a symbolic sun/power diagram

in the chat area's CSS. Apply a strong **CSS opacity mask** (e.g., $5\%$-$10\%$) so the background is present but does not interfere with reading the text. |
| **Background Color** | Set the main chat area background to the soft brand accent color (`#F0F4F8`). | Apply this hex code to the main container or body of the chat component. |
| **Custom First Message** | The agent's first, unprompted response to the user must be the custom greeting. | Update the initial state or initialization function of the chat agent: **Output:** "Hello\! I'm **SOLSTICE**, an AI assistant helping you to understand the landscape of solar installation. Let's start with your location and consumption." |
| **Chat Bubble Styling** | Update the styling of the *AI agent's* response bubbles to incorporate the **Primary Brand Accent** (`#00796B`) for a professional, branded look. | Use the hex code for the background color of the AI's message bubbles. |

### **III. Final Commit Instructions**

1.  Confirm the new logo is correctly displayed on all pages (header, chat, etc.).
2.  Verify the chat background is present but subtle, using the specified hex codes.
3.  Commit all code and styling changes to your connected GitHub repository.
4.  **Documentation Protocol:** Update the **`CHANGELOG.md`** file with the following detailed entry before the final commit.
