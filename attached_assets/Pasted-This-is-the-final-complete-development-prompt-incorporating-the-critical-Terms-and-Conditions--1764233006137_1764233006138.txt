      * **Refusal Protocol:** The agent must politely refuse out-of-scope queries (finance, health, general repairs, brand comparisons) using the canned response: *"I apologize, I am Solstice, an AI specialist focused exclusively on rooftop solar installation feasibility, savings, and compliance for Maharashtra. I cannot assist with topics outside this domain (e.g., finance, health, general repairs, or specific brand endorsements)."*
2.  **Branding & Style Confirmation:**
      * **Logo:** Final logo image  used site-wide.
      * **Aesthetics:** Vibrant Solar Theme (Yellow/Orange: e.g., `#FFF8E1`, `#FF9800`).
      * **Footer Attribution:** The final corrected text must be used in the chat window footer: **`© 2025 Solstice Terms of Use Powered by Solstice AI`**

### **II. Page Structure & Content Implementation**

#### **A. Marketing Landing Page (`/`) Finalization**

  * **Hero Subhead (USP):** *"We demystify solar—from tariff slabs to subsidies—with AI-driven clarity. Get the precise budget, roadmap, and knowledge you need to start generating your own power today."*
  * **FAQ Integration:** Add the 10-point FAQ component near the bottom of the landing page.
  * **Background Style:** Apply the **vibrant yellow/orange subtle background pattern** (5% opacity).

#### **B. Final Page Structure Updates**

  * **Pricing:** Price on `/plans` is **₹999/month**.
  * **Team:** Photos for Dr. Amulya Guduri and Kruthika Kanduri must be integrated using their respective file names (`amulya guduri` and `kruthika kanduri`).
  * **New Route:** Add a link to the new **`/terms`** page in the global footer.

#### **C. New Feature: Terms and Conditions Page (`/terms`)**

  * **Action:** Create a new page at the route `/terms`.
  * **Content Injection (CRITICAL):** Inject the following adapted text precisely, replacing all individual references with the company name and updating the scope to match the project:
