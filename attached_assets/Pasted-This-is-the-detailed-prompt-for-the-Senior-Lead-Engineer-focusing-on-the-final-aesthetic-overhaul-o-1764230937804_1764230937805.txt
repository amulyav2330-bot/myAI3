## 💻 Senior Lead Engineer Prompt: Final Vibrant UI Overhaul (V2.5)

**To:** Senior Lead Engineer
**From:** Product Manager
**Project:** Final Aesthetic Refinement on the **Solstice Chat Interface**
**Deployment Environment:** Replit

**Objective:** Transform the chat interface (`/app/chat/demo`) into a vibrant, high-energy environment using solar-themed colors (Yellow/Orange), integrating the final logo, and correcting the footer attribution to the agreed-upon text.

### **I. Branding & Styling Protocol**

1.  **Logo File:** Use the final uploaded logo image  across all components.
2.  **Color Palette (NEW):** Analyze the solar energy theme for the chat UI.
      * **Primary Background Color (Vibrant):** Use a light, warm yellow/orange base, e.g., `#FFF8E1` or a very light pastel orange.
      * **Accent Color 1 (Yellow/Gold):** `#FFC107` (Used for subtle highlighting, active states).
      * **Accent Color 2 (Orange/Sunset):** `#FF9800` (Used for user chat bubbles, strong emphasis).
      * **AI Bubble Color (Contrast):** Use the previous brand color or a stark contrast like `#E0F2F1` for AI messages to distinguish clearly from user input.

### **II. Chat Interface (`/app/chat/demo`) Implementation**

| Feature | Requirement | Technical Implementation Details |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Background Color** | Set the main chat area background to the soft, warm color. | Apply the hex code, e.g., `#FFF8E1`, to the main container or body of the chat component. |
| **Custom Background Image** | Integrate the fading solar panel image into the background. | Use the solar panel image (referencing

) as a background image. **CRITICAL:** Set a very high opacity mask (e.g., $95\%$ transparency/ $5\%$ visibility) to ensure the vibrant background and text remain readable. Use the orange/yellow tones to colorize the fade effect. |
| **Custom First Message** | The agent's first, unprompted response must be the custom greeting. | Update the initialization function of the chat agent: **Greeting:** "Hello\! I'm **SOLSTICE**, an AI assistant helping you to understand the landscape of solar installation. Let's start with your location and consumption." |
| **Chat Bubble Styling** | Update the styling to reflect the new theme. | **User Input Bubbles:** Use **Accent Color 2 (`#FF9800`)** or a variant. **AI Agent Bubbles:** Use a clear contrasting color (e.g., `#E0F2F1`). |
| **Header Logo Integration** | **CONFIRM:** The new logo  is displayed at the top of the chat window. | Ensure proper scaling. |
| **Footer Attribution Change (FINAL)** | Implement the final approved attribution text. | **Locate the chat footer component** and update the text to the final version: **NEW:** `© 2025 Solstice Terms of Use Powered by Solstice AI` |

### **III. Final Commit Instructions**

1.  Confirm the chat UI is vibrant and readable, and the logo and footer text are correct.
