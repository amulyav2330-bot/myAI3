## 🚀 Senior Lead Engineer Prompt: Solstice SaaS Platform Refactoring (V2.1 - Production Build)

**To:** Senior Lead Engineer
**From:** Product Manager
**Project:** Refactoring **Simple Chat App** to **Solstice SaaS Platform**
**Deployment Environment:** Replit (Connected to GitHub/Vercel)
**Current Status:** Agent logic (RAG/Pinecone/Vercel) is stable. Frontend is a basic, direct-to-chat interface.

**Objective:** Implement the final, multi-page, responsive SaaS marketing platform, **"Solstice"**, integrating all enhanced features, custom content, and adhering to strict compliance and documentation protocols.

-----

### **I. Architectural & Compliance Protocol (Mandatory)**

1.  **Routing Overhaul:**
      * Set the root route (`/`) to load the new **Marketing Landing Page**.
      * Move the current chat application to the protected route: `/app/chat/demo`.
      * Establish dedicated routes for: `/plans`, `/auth/login`, `/contact`, `/team`, `/info/solar-basics`.
2.  **Database Integrity (CRITICAL):**
      * **Do not modify** any existing backend code connecting to **Pinecone (Vector DB)** or the Vercel deployment structure. The RAG functionality must remain operational and accessible via the `/app/chat/demo` route.
3.  **Styling & Branding:**
      * **Primary Accent Color:** Use the hex code **`#3498DB`** (a bright, reliable blue) for all primary buttons, CTAs, and header elements.
      * **Logo:** Integrate the uploaded logo image  prominently in the header.
4.  **Responsiveness:**
      * All new and refactored components must be built using a **fully responsive design framework** (e.g., modern CSS grid/flexbox, Tailwind CSS, etc.) to ensure a seamless experience on all mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.

### **II. Page Structure & Component Implementation**

#### **A. Marketing Landing Page (New Root Route: `/`)**

| Section | Required Copy & Logic | Technical Implementation Details |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Header** | **Title:** Solstice (The sun's highest or lowest point). | Integrate the logo and apply the primary accent color to the navigation background or underline. |
| **Hero Section** | **Headline:** "Solstice: Your Peak Solar Performance Begins Here." **Subhead:** "Unlock maximum savings and power your future with regulatory-backed AI analysis." | High-impact, full-width component. |
| **Value Proposition** | **What We Do:** "We unify MSEDCL tariffs, MNRE subsidies, and VNM regulations into a single, personalized financial report." **Who We Cater To:** "Citizens and residents exploring solar panel installation options and aiming for energy independence." **USP:** "Guaranteed Compliance. Real-time ROI. **A Better Tomorrow, Starting Today.**" | Structured three-column responsive section below the hero. |
| **CTAs (Action Gates)**| **Button 1:** "Sign In / Sign Up" (Routes to `/auth/login`). **Button 2:** "View Plans" (Routes to `/plans`). **Button 3 (Demo):** "Try Free Demo" (Routes to `/app/chat/demo`). | All buttons must use the `#3498DB` primary color. |
| **Testimonials** | Display three distinct testimonial blocks (dummy data): **1. Financial Savings, 2. Environmental Impact, 3. Education/Knowledge.** (Use provided quotes). | Implement as a responsive grid layout or carousel at the bottom of the page. |
| **Footer** | Contact Email: `contact@solstice.com`. Links to: `/contact`, `/team`, `/plans`, `/info/solar-basics`. | Standard footer component. |

#### **B. Supporting Pages**

1.  **Pricing/Plans Page (`/plans`)**

      * Structure two tiers: **"Solstice Free"** (Limited Demo functionality) and **"Solstice Pro"** (Paid Plan).
      * **"Solstice Pro" Feature List:** Detail features like "Unlimited ROI Reports," "Full Compliance Auditing," and "Presentation Export."
      * **CTA:** Button labeled "Upgrade to Solstice Pro" (Routes to a dummy checkout/billing page).

2.  **Meet the Team Page (`/team`)**

      * Display two founders: **Dr. Amulya Guduri** and **Kruthika Kanduri**.
      * **Dr. Amulya Guduri (CEO, AI & Compliance Strategist):** Bio must focus on AI, financial modeling, and public policy. Include a dedicated avatar/placeholder image and a dummy LinkedIn URL.
      * **Kruthika Kanduri (CTO, Engineering Lead):** Bio must focus on platform development, data architecture, and solar technology. Include a dedicated avatar/placeholder image and a dummy LinkedIn URL.

3.  **Solar Basics Page (`/info/solar-basics`)**

      * Content must define key concepts: **kW (Capacity)**, **Net Metering**, **Inverter Function**.
      * **Visual Integration:** Embed the **Single-Line Diagram (SLD)** graphic

[Image of Single Line Diagram for Grid-Tied Solar System]
to illustrate the system flow (Sunlight $\to$ DC $\to$ Inverter $\to$ AC $\to$ Home/Grid).

4.  **Contact Us Page (`/contact`)**
      * Standard form and display of the business contact email (`contact@solstice.com`).

#### **C. Application Interface Enhancement (`/app/chat/demo`)**

| Feature | Requirement | Implementation Logic & Protocol |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Web Search Integration (CRITICAL)** | When the AI mentions an external entity, automatically trigger a web search and resolve the link. | **Protocol:** In the backend function responsible for processing the AI's final output, implement logic that checks for known external keywords (e.g., MSEDCL, SBI, partner name). **Logic:** If keyword is found, execute `web_search(keyword + " official website")` and append the **direct, clickable URL link** to the chat output. |

### **III. Final Commit & Documentation Instructions**

1.  Confirm all new routes, responsive styling, and component integrations are functional.
2.  Commit all changes to your connected GitHub repository.

**Documentation Protocol (CRITICAL):**
