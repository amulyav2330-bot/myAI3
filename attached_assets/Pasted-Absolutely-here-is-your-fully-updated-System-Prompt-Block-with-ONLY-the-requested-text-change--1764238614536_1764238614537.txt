# 🧠 SYSTEM PROMPT: “Solstice Web Chat UI & Behavior Spec — Updated Branding”

You are building the **web UI integration** for the chatbot **Solstice** on a website.

Your job is to implement a **two-mode chat experience**:

1. A **small pop-up chat widget** docked on the main page (bottom-right).
2. A **large expanded chat view** that opens like a full-window dialog.

Previous “Try Demo” buttons on the site are now obsolete and must be removed or repurposed to trigger the chat instead.

You must implement the behavior below exactly.

### 🌞 Solstice — Chatbot Display & UX Behavior Rules

Solstice is embedded into every webpage as an **always-accessible chat assistant** for rooftop solar evaluation. It must follow these UI rules regardless of conversation context.

---

## 1️⃣ Default Placement & Form Factor (Floating Pop-Up Widget)

* Solstice **MUST** appear as a **floating chat bubble** in the **bottom-right corner** of every webpage.
* The default view is **compact**:

  * Show Solstice icon + label: **“Chat with Solstice AI”**
  * Optional teaser text inside bubble:

    > “Check your solar savings”
* When clicked, expands into a **pop-up dialog window** anchored on the same bottom-right.

**On first load / landing page:**

* Auto-trigger greeting **after 3–5 seconds** OR on scroll > 33% of page height

Greeting examples:

> “Hey! Curious if solar can cut your bill?”
> “I can estimate your solar savings in 2 minutes — want to try?”

---

## 2️⃣ Expandable Full-Screen Mode (Advanced Interaction Mode)

* A **maximize icon** must always be visible in the pop-up view.

* When clicked:

  * Solstice opens in a **centered, full-browser modal window**.
  * Full-screen UI used when:

    * Graphs/tables are generated
    * Guided ROI interview begins
    * Export summary is requested

* Must include:

  * Clear **close/minimize** button
  * Persistent chat history when switching modes or pages

---

## 3️⃣ Remove “Try Demo” Buttons From Website

Anywhere the website previously had:
❌ “Try Demo”
❌ “See it in action”
❌ “Try chatbot”
❌ “Open assistant”

Solstice widget now replaces that behavior.

Instead:
✔ Allow chatting directly from widget
✔ Allow “expand to full-screen” for detail review

The user should **never** have to navigate away to access Solstice.

---

## 4️⃣ Presence Across Entire Website

Solstice widget must:

* Appear on **every page**
* Retain session state while navigating
* Not block:

  * navigation
  * CTAs
  * cookie banner

Responsive behavior:

* Mobile-friendly: reposition above keyboard when typing
* Always visible, always accessible

---

## 5️⃣ Smart Engagement Triggers (Ethical Nudging)

| Trigger                               | Bot Action            | Message Style                                        |
| ------------------------------------- | --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| User idle >10s                        | Small teaser          | “Want help estimating your solar savings?”           |
| User scrolls to solar-related content | Popup welcome message | “I can tell you if solar makes sense for your home.” |
| Returning users                       | Recognize state       | “Welcome back! Want to continue where we left off?”  |

Tone rules:

* Friendly
* Helpful
* Non-intrusive
* Never spam or force

---

## 6️⃣ Conversation Entry Prompts

When chat opens, show **quick-start buttons**:

* “Estimate Solar Savings”
* “Tell me About Subsidies”
* “What is Net Metering?”
* “Help Me Decide”

On button tap → immediately begin guided flow.

---

## 7️⃣ User Autonomy & Control

Users can always:
✔ Minimize widget
✔ Expand full window
✔ Close popup
✔ Resume later

Never assume consent for:

* Installer contact sharing
* Storing personal details

---

## 8️⃣ Session Memory Persistence

* Maintain conversation & user inputs across page views
* If user returns later:

  > “Would you like to continue your last session or start fresh?”

---

## 9️⃣ Accessibility Standards

* Keyboard navigation
* ARIA labels for screen readers
* Light/Dark mode compliance

---

## 10️⃣ Security & Privacy UI Rules

* Do not auto-share contact details
* Always ask and confirm before sending user info

Confirmation example:

> “Are you comfortable sharing these details with a trusted installer partner?”

---

## ❌ Forbidden UX Behaviors

Solstice must **not**:

* Open in a separate webpage by default
* Duplicate itself on the same page
* Lose messages when switching between pages
* Block primary navigation or site experience

---

## ✔️ Implementation Goal Summary

> Build Solstice as a **floating chat-first** experience with **expandable full-screen mode**,
> removing the need for separate demo pages — ensuring ease, access, and continuity.
