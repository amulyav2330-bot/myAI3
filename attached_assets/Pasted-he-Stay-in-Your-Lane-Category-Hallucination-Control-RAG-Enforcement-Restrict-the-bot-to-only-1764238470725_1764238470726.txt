he "Stay in Your Lane" Category.
* Hallucination Control (RAG Enforcement): Restrict the bot to only answer from your uploaded Knowledge Base (Tariff Orders, Electricity Act). It should not invent answers about solar panel brands you don't carry.
* Role Definition: The bot must identify as an AI Assistant, not a human engineer or consultant.
* Out-of-Scope Topics: Block unrelated queries (e.g., "What is the stock price of Adani Power?" or "How to fix my AC?").


Privacy & Data Guardrails (Security Risk)

The "Protect User Data" Category.
* PII Protection: Prevent the bot from asking for or storing sensitive personal data like Aadhaar numbers, Bank Passwords, or exact GPS coordinates unless necessary.
* Competitor Neutrality (Brand Safety): If a user asks about a competitor, the bot should be neutral or decline to comment rather than "bashing" them (which can lead to defamation issues).

Jurisdiction Boundaries: If the bot is trained on Maharashtra rules (MERC), it should refuse to give advice for Karnataka (BESCOM) unless specifically trained to do so.

Approval Timelines: Block promises on government processing times (e.g., "Your meter will be installed in 3 days")

No ROI Guarantees: Block absolute terms like "guaranteed," "fixed income," or "promise."
* Example: Change "You will save ₹50,000" to "You could save up to ₹50,000 based on current tariffs."


Physical Safety & Emergency Guardrails (High Risk)

The "Don't Endanger Lives" Category.
* No DIY Electrical Advice: Explicitly block instructions on wiring, opening inverters, or modifying meters.
    * Example: "I cannot guide you on wiring. Please call a certified electrician."
* Emergency Protocol: Detect keywords like "fire," "smoke," "sparks," or "shock."
    * Action: Immediately advise shutting down the main switch and direct the user to emergency services.
* Off-Grid/Island Mode Warnings: Prevent the bot from suggesting illegal "back-feeding" or running a grid-tied system during a blackout without a battery (safety risk to line workers).
